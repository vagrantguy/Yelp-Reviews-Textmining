# Yelp-Reviews-Textmining

Used Python to fetch restaurant reviews from Yelp, and leveraged Natural Language Processing skills to parse them; built multiple classification models, such as K Nearest Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression to identify the sentiment of a review as positive or negative.
